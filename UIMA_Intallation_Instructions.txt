Then you need to setup the environment vars. If you are working with bash you need to set the following vars in the .bash_profile.sh file to always have it running in your terminal. If you want a more global set when you start your session you need to set them in the  file. The variables and values are as follows:

1) UIMA_HOME=/usr/local/apache-uima-as   	[ path to your uima-as-2.4.x folder ]
2) UIMA_CLASSPATH=./target:./target/dependency	[ path to your UIMA binaries, imported by Maven ]
3) JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle		[ set it to the path where your JDK is installed ] 
4) CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib			[ set it to the JDK binaries ]
